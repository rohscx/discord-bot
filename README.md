# 🔊 Lounge Bot

A lightweight Discord bot that notifies your server when someone joins a voice channel — so nobody misses out when the squad is hanging out.

## What It Does

When a member joins the **Lounge** voice channel, the bot posts a notification to a designated text channel with:

- **Who joined** the voice channel
- **Who's already there** — see the full list of current members
- **What they're up to** — game activity, Spotify, streaming status

### Spam Prevention

If someone disconnects and rejoins within a configurable time window (default: 2 hours), the bot suppresses the notification to keep the text channel clean. No more notification spam from flaky connections.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the following **Privileged Gateway Intents** enabled:
  - Server Members Intent
  - Presence Intent

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohscx/discord-bot.git
cd discord-bot
```

### 2. Set up environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TEXT_CHANNEL_ID=your_text_channel_id_here
TIME_THRESHOLD=7200  # Spam suppression window in seconds (default: 2 hours)
```

> **How to get the Channel ID:** Enable Developer Mode in Discord (Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode), then right-click the text channel and select "Copy Channel ID".

### 3. Run it

**Option A: Python (venv)**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lounge_bot.py
```

**Option B: systemd (Linux server)**

A systemd service file and install script are provided in the `deploy/` directory for running the bot as a persistent background service:

```bash
bash deploy/install.sh
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment (if needed)
- Install dependencies
- Install and enable the systemd service
- Start the bot

Manage the service with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status lounge-bot    # Check status
sudo systemctl restart lounge-bot   # Restart
sudo journalctl -u lounge-bot -f    # View live logs
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | Your Discord bot token |
| `TEXT_CHANNEL_ID` | ✅ | — | Channel ID where notifications are posted |
| `VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` | ❌ | — | Voice channel ID to monitor (preferred — immutable) |
| `VOICE_CHANNEL_NAME` | ❌ | `Lounge` | Voice channel name fallback (used if ID not set) |
| `TIME_THRESHOLD` | ❌ | `7200` | Seconds before a rejoin triggers a new notification |
| `OFFICE_HOURS_ENABLED` | ❌ | `false` | Enable quiet hours (see below) |
| `OFFICE_HOURS_START` | ❌ | `06:00` | Start of notification window (HH:MM) |
| `OFFICE_HOURS_END` | ❌ | `22:30` | End of notification window (HH:MM) |
| `OFFICE_HOURS_TZ` | ❌ | `US/Eastern` | Timezone for office hours (handles DST automatically) |

### Office Hours

When enabled, notifications sent **outside** the configured window will still be posted to the text channel but **without the `@here` ping**. This way late-night gaming sessions don't buzz everyone's phone, but the activity is still visible for anyone who checks the channel.

```
# Example: Only ping between 6 AM and 10:30 PM Eastern
OFFICE_HOURS_ENABLED=true
OFFICE_HOURS_START=06:00
OFFICE_HOURS_END=22:30
OFFICE_HOURS_TZ=US/Eastern
```

Overnight windows are also supported (e.g., `OFFICE_HOURS_START=22:00`, `OFFICE_HOURS_END=06:00` would ping during the late-night hours).

## How It Works

```
Member joins "Lounge" voice channel
        │
        ▼
  Actually in channel?  ──no──▶  Discard (stale gateway event)
        │
        yes
        │
        ▼
  Joined recently?  ──yes──▶  Suppress notification (log only)
        │
        no
        │
        ▼
  Within office hours?
    │           │
   yes          no
    │           │
    ▼           ▼
  Post with   Post WITHOUT
  @here ping  @here ping
```

## Deployment

The bot needs a persistent connection to Discord's gateway, so it must run on something that stays on 24/7. Use the systemd service in `deploy/` for Linux servers (EC2, etc.). Serverless platforms (Cloud Run, Lambda) are not compatible — they idle and kill WebSocket connections.
